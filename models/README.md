# **Starter Project:** Generating Eeveelution Point Clouds With Point Set Generation Network
## Repo By Vadim Kudlay

Files in `models/` specify the structures and training loops of the models used in the analysis. 

- [`cae.py`](cae.py), [`cvae.py`](cvae.py), and [`gan.py`](gan.py) specify the model classes used in so far as the construction and 
training loop is concerned.
- [`losses.py`](losses.py) specifies the loss functions used in the experiments.
- [`model_bank.py`](model_bank.py) specifies the network structures of the models.
