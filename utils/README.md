Files in `utils/` are meant to help aggregate common utilities used in the analysis. 

- [`mesh_ops.py`](mesh_ops.py) specifies functions to be used on mesh or mesh-like structures, including manipulation and visualization. 
- [`status_tracker.py`](status_tracker.py) specifies a logging class that helps in the running of experiments by automatically checkpointing and retrieving model run information while also saving visual/status exports from the training loop.
